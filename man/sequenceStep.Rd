\title{Simulate Sequencing from Amplified Fragments}
\usage{
sequenceStep(amp_frags, totalDepth, sf_sd = 0.03)
}
\arguments{
\item{amp_frags}{A matrix or data frame of PCR-amplified fragment counts for each sgRNA (e.g., the output from \code{amplifyStep}).}

\item{totalDepth}{Total sequencing depth to allocate across all sgRNAs. Default is \code{1e9}.}

\item{sf_sd}{Standard deviation of the sampling fluctuation applied during sequencing.}
}
\value{
A data frame of simulated read counts for each sgRNA after sequencing, incorporating stochastic sampling noise.
}
\description{
This function simulates the sequencing output from PCR-amplified sgRNA fragments.
After amplification, sequencing introduces additional variability due to technical noise.
